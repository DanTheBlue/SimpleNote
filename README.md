##Why?

I like to take notes for things like ideas, meetings, or anything that I want to quickly jot down.

I mainly used everynote for this, but found the linux support poor, and also had no way of moving away easily.

I tried quiver, and loved it, but found the lack of support for other OS's not suitable for my needs.

So, SimpleNote was born.
